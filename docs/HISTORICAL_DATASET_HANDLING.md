# Historical Dataset Handling Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide covers best practices for handling historical datasets and time-series data in GeoQuest, based on recent work with education data spanning from 1870 to 2020.

## üìÖ Understanding Historical Data

### What Are Historical Datasets?

Historical datasets show the same metric across different time periods, allowing comparisons over time. Examples from recent work:
- Education data: 1870 vs 2020
- Population: Multiple years
- Economic indicators: Time series data

### When to Create Multiple Historical Datasets

Create separate datasets when:
1. **Significant Time Gap**: Large gaps (e.g., 1870 vs 2020) show dramatic changes
2. **Different Contexts**: Each year provides unique insights
3. **Complementary Metrics**: Related but inverse metrics (e.g., "no education" vs "some education")
4. **User Interest**: Comparison value is high

**Don't create separate datasets when:**
- Years are consecutive (e.g., 2021, 2022, 2023) - too granular
- Data is identical - no change over time
- Differences are negligible

## üóÇÔ∏è File Organization Strategy

### Naming Convention for Historical Data

**Include Year in Filename**:
```
[metric]_[year]_by_country.json
```

**Examples from Recent Work**:
```
share_population_no_education_1870_by_country.json
share_population_no_education_2020_by_country.json
share_population_some_education_1870_by_country.json
share_population_some_education_2020_by_country.json
```

### Title Formatting

**Include Year in Title**:
```json
{
  "title": "Share of Population with No Formal Education by Country (1870)",
  "description": "... according to Our World in Data (1870)."
}
```

**For Latest Data**:
```json
{
  "title": "Number of R&D Researchers per Million People by Country",
  "description": "... according to Our World in Data (2022)."
}
```

### Alphabetical Placement

Historical datasets should be placed together in `dataFiles` array:

```javascript
'share_population_no_education_1870_by_country.json',
'share_population_no_education_2020_by_country.json',
'share_population_some_education_1870_by_country.json',
'share_population_some_education_2020_by_country.json',
```

**Sorting Order**:
1. Metric name (alphabetically)
2. Year (chronologically within same metric)

## üìä Handling Complementary Datasets

### Example: No Education vs Some Education

When creating complementary datasets (inverse metrics):

**Strategy 1: Separate Files (Recommended)**
```
File 1: share_population_no_education_2020_by_country.json
File 2: share_population_some_education_2020_by_country.json
```

**Why Separate?**
- ‚úÖ Clear, focused quiz questions
- ‚úÖ Independent dataset management
- ‚úÖ Better user experience (not confusing)
- ‚úÖ Easier to update one without affecting the other

**Strategy 2: Combined File (Not Recommended)**
```
File: education_status_2020_by_country.json
Data: { "no_education": {...}, "some_education": {...} }
```

**Why Not Combined?**
- ‚ùå Complex data structure
- ‚ùå Difficult to create quiz questions
- ‚ùå Mixing categorical data types

### Real-World Example from Recent Work

**Complementary Datasets Created**:

1. **No Education (1870)**:
   - `share_population_no_education_1870_by_country.json`
   - Shows % with NO formal education in 1870
   - Values: 0-100% (most countries near 100%)

2. **No Education (2020)**:
   - `share_population_no_education_2020_by_country.json`
   - Shows % with NO formal education in 2020
   - Values: 0-100% (most countries <10%)

3. **Some Education (1870)**:
   - `share_population_some_education_1870_by_country.json`
   - Shows % with AT LEAST SOME formal education in 1870
   - Values: 0-100% (most countries near 0%)
   - **Note**: Inverse of "no education" but separate dataset

4. **Some Education (2020)**:
   - `share_population_some_education_2020_by_country.json`
   - Shows % with AT LEAST SOME formal education in 2020
   - Values: 0-100% (most countries >90%)

**Key Insight**: Even though "no education" and "some education" are mathematically complementary, they serve as separate quiz questions and provide different educational value.

## üïê Year Selection Guidelines

### Choosing Target Years

**For Historical Comparison Datasets**:
- **Anchor Years**: Significant historical moments (1870, 1900, 1950, 2000)
- **Milestone Years**: Decades that mark changes (1990, 2000, 2010, 2020)
- **Data Availability**: Years with most complete country coverage

**For Latest Data**:
- **Most Recent Complete Year**: Latest year with comprehensive data
- **Current Year - 1 or 2**: If current year is incomplete
- **Stated in Source**: Use year explicitly stated in OWID or source

**Examples**:
- ‚úÖ 1870 (historical baseline for education)
- ‚úÖ 2020 (recent complete data, pre-COVID in many cases)
- ‚úÖ 2022 (current available data)
- ‚ùå 2024 (if only partial data available)
- ‚ùå Random years without significance

### Handling Missing Years

If source provides multiple years but you need specific years:

**Scenario 1: Target Year Has Data**
```
Source: 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020
Target: 2020
Action: Extract only 2020 data
```

**Scenario 2: Target Year Missing, Nearby Year Available**
```
Source: 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023
Target: 2020
Action: Consider using 2019 or 2021, note in description
```

**Scenario 3: Source Only Shows Trends**
```
Source: Shows "1989-2020" with only start/end values
Action: Use provided values, note date range in description
```

## üìù Description Best Practices

### Historical Context in Descriptions

**Include**:
1. **Time Period**: Explicitly state the year
2. **Historical Context**: If relevant, note significance
3. **Source Information**: Always attribute source and year

**Example from Recent Work**:
```json
{
  "description": "The share of adults aged between 15 and 64 years old with no formal education according to Our World in Data (1870)."
}
```

vs

```json
{
  "description": "The share of adults aged between 15 and 64 years old with no formal education according to Our World in Data (2020)."
}
```

### Indicating Time Periods

**Clear Year Notation**:
- ‚úÖ "... according to Our World in Data (1870)."
- ‚úÖ "... according to Our World in Data (2020)."
- ‚ùå "... historical data from OWID"
- ‚ùå "... data from various years"

## üîÑ Data Consistency Across Years

### Ensuring Comparable Data

When creating historical comparison datasets:

1. **Same Source**: Use same data source for all years
2. **Same Methodology**: Ensure methodology is consistent
3. **Same Countries**: Include same country set when possible
4. **Same Units**: Verify units are consistent across years

### Handling Methodology Changes

**If Methodology Changed**:
- Note in description: "Methodology updated in [year]"
- Consider separate datasets if methodology differs significantly
- Document differences clearly

**Example**:
```json
{
  "description": "Share of population with no formal education. Note: Data collection methodology was updated in 1990, so values may not be directly comparable to earlier years."
}
```

## üéØ Implementation Workflow

### Step-by-Step: Creating Historical Datasets

**Step 1: Identify Comparison Points**
- Determine which years to include
- Assess data availability for each year
- Consider significance of time periods

**Step 2: Extract Data for Each Year**
- Extract data separately for each target year
- Maintain consistent country coverage
- Note any data quality differences

**Step 3: Standardize Across Years**
- Apply same country name standardization
- Use consistent data structure
- Maintain same units and formatting

**Step 4: Create Separate Files**
- One file per year (for significant gaps)
- Consistent naming: `[metric]_[year]_by_country.json`
- Include year in title and description

**Step 5: Add to Quiz System**
- Add all files to `dataFiles` array
- Place together alphabetically by metric, then by year
- Test all datasets independently

## üìä Real-World Example: Education Historical Data

### The Complete Set

**Files Created** (4 complementary datasets):

1. `share_population_no_education_1870_by_country.json`
   - 1870 baseline for no education
   - Most countries near 100%
   - Historical starting point

2. `share_population_no_education_2020_by_country.json`
   - 2020 current state of no education
   - Most countries <10%
   - Shows improvement over 150 years

3. `share_population_some_education_1870_by_country.json`
   - 1870 baseline for some education
   - Most countries near 0%
   - Inverse perspective

4. `share_population_some_education_2020_by_country.json`
   - 2020 current state of some education
   - Most countries >90%
   - Shows achievement over time

### Why This Structure Works

1. **Clear Quiz Questions**: Each file becomes a distinct quiz
2. **Easy Comparison**: Users can mentally compare 1870 vs 2020
3. **Complementary Learning**: "No education" and "some education" reinforce each other
4. **Time Context**: Year clearly indicated in filename, title, description

### User Experience

When users encounter these datasets:
- Can select "Share of Population with No Formal Education (1870)"
- Can select "Share of Population with No Formal Education (2020)"
- Can mentally compare the dramatic change
- Can understand both "no education" and "some education" perspectives

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Mixing Years in One Dataset
**Problem**: Including multiple years in one file
**Solution**: Create separate files for significant time gaps

### Pitfall 2: Inconsistent Country Coverage
**Problem**: Different countries in different years
**Solution**: Note in description if coverage differs, maintain same country set when possible

### Pitfall 3: Unclear Year Notation
**Problem**: Year not clearly indicated in filename or title
**Solution**: Always include year in both filename and title

### Pitfall 4: Forgetting to Update All Years
**Problem**: Updating one year but not related years
**Solution**: When updating historical datasets, check all related years

## üéØ Best Practices Summary

1. **Separate Files for Significant Gaps**: 50+ year gaps deserve separate datasets
2. **Clear Year Indication**: Year in filename, title, and description
3. **Consistent Naming**: Follow pattern: `[metric]_[year]_by_country.json`
4. **Alphabetical Grouping**: Place related years together in `dataFiles`
5. **Complementary Datasets**: Create separate files even for inverse metrics
6. **Source Attribution**: Always include source URL and year
7. **Description Context**: Include time period significance if relevant
8. **Data Consistency**: Use same source, methodology, units across years
