# Our World in Data (OWID) Integration Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide specializes in integrating datasets from Our World in Data (OWID), a common source for global statistics. This guide covers the specific patterns, challenges, and best practices for OWID data.

## üìä OWID Data Characteristics

### Data Source Format
OWID provides data in tabular format via their grapher tool:
- **URL Pattern**: `https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/[dataset-name]?tab=table`
- **Table View**: Shows country names, years, and values
- **Time Series**: Often includes multiple years
- **Format**: HTML table view (requires manual extraction)

### Common OWID Dataset Types

1. **Education Metrics**
   - Learning outcomes
   - Enrollment rates
   - Years of schooling
   - Completion rates

2. **Health Metrics**
   - Life expectancy
   - Mortality rates
   - Disease prevalence
   - Healthcare access

3. **Environmental Metrics**
   - Air pollution
   - Energy consumption
   - Emissions
   - Water access

4. **Economic Metrics**
   - GDP indicators
   - Income data
   - Trade statistics
   - Development indices

## üîç OWID Country Name Challenges

### Common Name Variations in OWID

OWID uses standardized names, but some still need mapping:

**Direct Matches** (No change needed):
- ‚úÖ Most countries: "United States", "China", "India", "Brazil"
- ‚úÖ Standard names: "Germany", "France", "Japan"

**Requires Standardization**:
```
OWID Name ‚Üí GeoQuest Name
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
Czechia ‚Üí Czech Republic
Congo ‚Üí Republic of the Congo (check context!)
Cote d'Ivoire ‚Üí C√¥te d'Ivoire
East Timor ‚Üí Timor-Leste
Eswatini ‚Üí Eswatini (usually correct)
Micronesia (country) ‚Üí Micronesia
```

**Special Cases**:

1. **Korea**:
   - OWID rarely lists Korea separately
   - Usually appears as "South Korea" or "North Korea" correctly
   - Check for "Korea" without qualification

2. **China/Hong Kong/Macau**:
   - OWID: "China", "Hong Kong", "Macao"
   - GeoQuest: "China", "Hong Kong", "Macau" (note: Macao vs Macau)

3. **Historical Entities**:
   - OWID may include historical regions
   - Exclude: "USSR", "Yugoslavia", "East Germany", "West Germany"

### Aggregate Regions to Exclude

OWID commonly includes these aggregate regions (always exclude):

**World Regions**:
- ‚ùå "World"
- ‚ùå "Africa"
- ‚ùå "Asia"
- ‚ùå "Europe"
- ‚ùå "Americas" / "North America" / "South America"
- ‚ùå "Oceania"

**Income Groups**:
- ‚ùå "High-income countries"
- ‚ùå "Upper-middle-income countries"
- ‚ùå "Lower-middle-income countries"
- ‚ùå "Low-income countries"

**Regional Groupings**:
- ‚ùå "East Asia and Pacific (WB)"
- ‚ùå "Europe and Central Asia (WB)"
- ‚ùå "Latin America and Caribbean (WB)"
- ‚ùå "Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan (WB)"
- ‚ùå "South Asia (WB)"
- ‚ùå "Sub-Saharan Africa (WB)"
- ‚ùå "European Union (27)"

**WB = World Bank grouping - always exclude these**

## üìã OWID Data Extraction Process

### Step 1: Access the OWID Grapher

1. Navigate to: `https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/[dataset-name]`
2. Click "Table" tab to see data in tabular format
3. Identify the year column you want (often multiple years available)

### Step 2: Extract Data

**Manual Extraction** (from HTML table):
- Copy data from table view
- Paste into spreadsheet/text editor
- Clean and format

**Key Information to Extract**:
- Country names
- Values for target year
- Any notes or methodology information
- Source attribution

### Step 3: Determine Target Year

OWID datasets often span many years. Choose:
- **Most Recent Year**: For current data (e.g., 2022, 2023, 2024)
- **Specific Historical Year**: For historical comparisons (e.g., 1870, 1990, 2000)
- **Latest Complete Year**: If current year is incomplete

**Example from Recent Work**:
- Learning Outcomes: 2020 (latest complete data at time)
- R&D Researchers: 2022 (most recent available)
- Education (No Education): Both 1870 and 2020 (for comparison)

### Step 4: Handle Missing Data

OWID often shows:
- **Empty cells**: No data available
- **"N/A" or "-"**: Missing value
- **Notes**: Special conditions or limitations

**Handling Missing Data**:
- If country has no value for target year: **exclude** from dataset
- Don't include entries with null, undefined, or empty values
- Only include countries with valid numeric data

## üîß OWID-Specific Standardization

### Standardization Workflow for OWID Data

```javascript
// Common OWID standardization patterns
const owidStandardizations = {
    // Country names
    "Czechia": "Czech Republic",
    "Cote d'Ivoire": "C√¥te d'Ivoire",
    "East Timor": "Timor-Leste",
    "Micronesia (country)": "Micronesia",
    
    // Sometimes OWID has these (rarely):
    "Korea, South": "South Korea",
    "Korea, North": "North Korea",
    
    // Check context for:
    "Congo": "Republic of the Congo", // Or might need "Congo" - check data!
};
```

### Aggregate Region Detection

Always check for and exclude these patterns:
```javascript
const excludePatterns = [
    /^World$/i,
    /^Africa$/i,
    /^Asia$/i,
    /^Europe$/i,
    /Americas?/i,
    /Oceania/i,
    /income countries/i,
    /\(WB\)/i,              // World Bank groupings
    /European Union/i,
    /OECD/i,
    /Arab World/i,
];
```

## üìù OWID Dataset Template

### Standard OWID Dataset Structure

```json
{
  "title": "[Metric Name] by Country",
  "description": "[Detailed description of metric]. According to Our World in Data ([Year]).",
  "unit": "[unit of measurement]",
  "source": "https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/[dataset-name]",
  "data": {
    "Country Name": {
      "value": 123.45,
      "unit": "[unit]"
    }
  }
}
```

### OWID Description Template

**Good OWID Description**:
```
"[Metric name] according to Our World in Data ([Year]). [Brief methodology if relevant]."
```

**Examples from Recent Work**:
- "Average learning outcomes correspond to harmonized test scores across standardized, psychometrically-robust international and regional student achievement tests according to Our World in Data (2020)."
- "The share of adults aged between 15 and 64 years old with no formal education according to Our World in Data (1870)."
- "Professionals engaged in conceiving or creating new knowledge, products, processes, methods, or systems. Number of R&D researchers per million people according to Our World in Data (2022)."

## üéØ Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Learning Outcomes Dataset

**Source**: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-harmonized-learning-outcome-scores

**Challenges Encountered**:
- Data was for 2020 (chosen as target year)
- Country names were mostly correct
- Had to exclude regional aggregates

**Standardization Applied**:
- "Czechia" ‚Üí "Czech Republic" ‚úì
- Most others were already correct ‚úì

**Final Structure**:
```json
{
  "title": "Average Learning Outcomes by Country",
  "description": "Average learning outcomes correspond to harmonized test scores...",
  "unit": "score",
  "source": "https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-harmonized-learning-outcome-scores",
  "data": {
    "Singapore": { "value": 575.27, "unit": "score" },
    // ... 170+ countries
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Historical Education Data

**Source**: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-population-15-years-and-older-with-no-education

**Challenges Encountered**:
- Two datasets needed: 1870 and 2020
- Complementary datasets (no education + some education)
- Historical data had more missing values

**Standardization Applied**:
- Created separate files for each year
- Standardized both "no education" and "some education" datasets
- Ensured complementary datasets were consistent

**Files Created**:
1. `share_population_no_education_1870_by_country.json`
2. `share_population_no_education_2020_by_country.json`
3. `share_population_some_education_1870_by_country.json`
4. `share_population_some_education_2020_by_country.json`

### Example 3: R&D Researchers

**Source**: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/researchers-in-rd-per-million-people

**Challenges Encountered**:
- 2022 data extraction
- Many countries with missing data (had to exclude)
- Special handling for countries with very low values

**Standardization Applied**:
- Standardized all country names
- Excluded countries with no 2022 data
- Handled low values appropriately (e.g., Myanmar: 26, Dominican Republic: 20)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common OWID Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Including Aggregate Regions
**Problem**: OWID often includes World Bank groupings like "East Asia and Pacific (WB)"
**Solution**: Always check for and exclude any entries with "(WB)" suffix or regional names

### Pitfall 2: Missing Data Handling
**Problem**: OWID tables show empty cells or "-" for missing data
**Solution**: Only include countries with valid numeric values for the target year

### Pitfall 3: Year Selection
**Problem**: OWID may show multiple years, need to pick the right one
**Solution**: 
- Use most recent complete year
- Note year in filename and description
- Be consistent with year selection across related datasets

### Pitfall 4: Unit Confusion
**Problem**: OWID might use different units than expected
**Solution**: 
- Check the dataset description on OWID
- Verify unit matches the data
- Be consistent with unit naming (e.g., "percent" vs "%")

### Pitfall 5: Country Name Variations
**Problem**: Some country names appear differently in OWID
**Solution**:
- Always check against `COUNTRY_MAPPING_GUIDE.md`
- Verify especially: Czechia, Congo countries, Korea, China territories
